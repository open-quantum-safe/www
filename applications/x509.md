# X.509

X.509 certificates containing hybrid and post-quantum public keys and signatures can be generated using our [fork of OpenSSL](tls/#oqs-openssl) using the [common openssl 'x509' commands](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/x509.html) specifying post-quantum algorithm names as [listed here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl#authentication).

For a full walk-through on generating post-quantum X.509 certificates, see the [OQS-OpenSSL README section "TLS demo"](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/README.md#tls-demo).

The easiest way to execute post-quantum X509 operations is by [using the pre-built Docker image at Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openquantumsafe/curl).
