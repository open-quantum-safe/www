<h1>OQS algorithm performance visualizations</h1>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>These pages visualize measurements taken by the <b>now-defunct</b> <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling">OQS profiling</a> project. This project is not currently maintained, and these measurements are not up to date. The data contained here are not representative of the current liboqs main branch, nor are they representative of the liboqs main branch at the time they were collected. The liboqs version and commit for which they were collected can be seen by viewing the raw data, which is linked on each page below.</p>

<h2>Additional information</h2>

<p>Algorithms labelled <tt>-ref</tt> are reference (C-code only) implementations compiled without special CPU feature support. Algorithms without this moniker are compiled with all CPU extensions available but with code portability/distributability features switched on (see <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/CONFIGURE.md#OQS_DIST_BUILD">here for details about this option</a>). Algorithm names ending in <tt>-noport</tt> represent measurements taken without portability/distributability enabled (i.e., such code may crash when executed on machines without suitable performance-enhancing CPU features).</p>

<p>These graphs will be extended over time to other CPU types and cloud infrastructures.</p>
