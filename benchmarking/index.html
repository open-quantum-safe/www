<h2>Additional information</h2>

<p>Algorithms labelled <tt>-ref</tt> are reference (C-code only) implementations compiled without special CPU feature support. Algorithms without this moniker are compiled with all CPU extensions available but with code portability/distributability features switched on (see <a href="https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/CONFIGURE.md#OQS_DIST_BUILD">here for details about this option</a>). Algorithm names ending in <tt>-noport</tt> represent measurements taken without portability/distributability enabled (i.e., such code may crash when executed on machines without suitable performance-enhancing CPU features).</p>

<p>These graphs will be extended over time to other CPU types and cloud infrastructures.</p>
