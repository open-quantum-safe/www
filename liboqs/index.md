liboqs is an open source C library for quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms.

liboqs provides:


- a collection of open-source implementations of quantum-safe key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) and digital signature algorithms (see the [list of supported algorithms](algorithms))
- a common API for these algorithms
- a test harness and benchmarking routines

## Overview

**Open source**. liboqs is a C library for quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms, released under the MIT License. liboqs incorporates some external components which use a different license.

**Multi-platform**. liboqs builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows, supports x86_64 and ARM architectures (except Windows on ARM64), and the clang, gcc, and Microsoft compilers.  Toolchains are available for cross-compiling to other platforms. Not all algorithms are supported on all those platforms; always consult [the algorithm datasheets](algorithms) for details on each algorithm.

**Common API**. liboqs uses a common API for post-quantum key encapsulation and signature algorithms, making it easy to switch between algorithms. Our API closely follows the NIST/SUPERCOP API, with some additional wrappers and data structures.

**Testing and benchmarking**. liboqs includes a test harness and benchmarking routines to compare performance of post-quantum implementations in a common framework.

**Application integrations**. We provide integrations of liboqs into forks of a range of cryptographic [applications and protocols](../applications).

**Language wrappers**. Post-quantum algorithms from liboqs can be used in a variety of other programming languages using the provided [wrappers](wrappers).

Post-quantum algorithm implementations in liboqs are derived from the reference and optimized code submitted by teams to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project.  Some implementations come directly from teams; others come via the [PQClean project](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean).  See the [algorithm datasheets](algorithms) for the lineage of each algorithm's implementation.
