# Language wrappers

You can use post-quantum algorithms from liboqs in the following languages via language-specific wrappers that we make available:

- [C++](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp)
- [Go](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go)
- [Java](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java)
- [Python](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python)
- [Rust](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust)

The following language wrappers are no longer supported and are deprecated:

- [.Net](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet) <span class="label label-red">deprecated</span>

The following third-party language-specific wrappers have been made available by external parties:

- [PHP](https://github.com/Muzosh/liboqs-php) by Petr Muzikant
- [Python](https://github.com/alraddady/alkindi) by Khalid Alraddady
