# News and History

## History

The Open Quantum Safe project was founded as a research project by Michele Mosca and Douglas Stebila in 2014, and has grown with the help of many [contributors](/team/) and [sponsors](/about/sponsors).

In 2024, the Open Quantum Safe project joined the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/) as one of the launch projects of the [Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance](https://pqca.org/).
