## Introduction

The Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project is an open-source project that
aims to support the development and prototyping (of applications) of
quantum-resistant cryptography.

OQS consists of the following main lines of work: liboqs, an open source
C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, and prototype
integrations into protocols and applications, including a fork of the
widely used OpenSSL library. These tools support research by ourselves
and others. To reduce the hurdle for getting started and to aid the
uptake and use of these components, our tools are also available as
ready-to-use binaries in the form of Docker images and test servers.

In this short note, we provide an update on the Open Quantum Safe
project.

## liboqs

[liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) is an open source
C library for quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms. liboqs makes
accessible a collection of open-source implementations of quantum-safe
key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) and digital signature algorithms
through a common API. liboqs builds on Linux, macOS, and Windows, on
Intel, AMD, and ARM platforms. Some of the implementations of these
algorithms have been directly contributed to liboqs by members of the
NIST submission teams; others are incorporated from the
[PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean) project.

In March 2021, we released [version 0.5.0 of
liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/0.5.0),
which contains implementations of all algorithms that have advanced to
NIST Round 3 as finalists or alternate candidates (except GeMSS). This
version also includes optimized versions of most of these algorithms for
Intel platforms, which can be compiled to run optimized for a specific
architecture or in a portable executable with CPU extensions detected at
runtime.

**Testing.**
We run a battery of tests on the cryptographic primitives that we
provide: we test the functionality of each primitive on random inputs
and on its Known Answer Tests; we test for memory errors and undefined
behaviour using LLVM's ASan and UBSan tools; and we test for
secret-dependent branching using Valgrind.

The basic functionality tests are run by a continuous integration
system, and we are currently exploring ways to run the ASan, UBSan, and
Valgrind tests more regularly.

We are also in the process of expanding our tests with coverage-guided
fuzzing. We have developed a test harness that allows libFuzzer to
manipulate the outputs of random bit sources and random oracles. Using
this harness, the fuzzer can quickly explore code paths that are rarely
executed in random tests and which are not executed at all by the Known
Answer Tests. The fuzzer can also check that different implementations
of the same primitive behave identically on these rarely executed code
paths.

### Language wrappers

We provide a set of language wrappers that aid in using the liboqs C API
safely from within different different programming languages, including
[C++](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp),
[Go](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go),
[Python](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python),
[C\#](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet),
[Java](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java), and
[Rust](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust). All wrappers
use the same API (or as similar as possible, up to programming language
conventions and constraints), regardless of the programming language.

Low-level programming chores such as deallocating memory or zero-ing hot
memory (e.g., memory that used to store secret keys) are automatically
managed by the wrappers, allowing the programmer to switch focus from
the system code to the application code. All wrappers have zero
overhead, aside from the intrinsic overhead of calling C code from
within the corresponding programming language.

Unit testing suites and continuous integration for liboqs and its
language wrappers are provided via CircleCI, AppVeyor, and GitHub's
workflows.

## TLS

We've integrated liboqs into forks of BoringSSL and OpenSSL to provide
prototype post-quantum key exchange and authentication in the TLS
protocol. With respect to hybrid key exchange, these implementations
follow an [Internet-Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design/) currently under consideration by the IETF TLS
working group.

Our [OpenSSL 1.1.1 fork](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl)
implements post-quantum and hybrid key exchange and post-quantum public
key authentication in TLS 1.3, and also supports post-quantum algorithms
in X.509 certificate generation and S/MIME / CMS message handling. This
post-quantum-enabled OpenSSL fork can be used in many applications that
rely on OpenSSL, and we have successfully done so with the [Apache and
nginx web servers, HAProxy (an HTTP load balancer), and the curl
command-line HTTP
client](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos).

The [new architecture of the forthcoming OpenSSL
3.0](https://www.openssl.org/docs/OpenSSLStrategicArchitecture.html)
aims to make easy the integration of new cryptographic mechanisms. We
have made available an [OpenSSL 3
provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) that adds
post-quantum key exchange to TLS via a simple binary add-on (shared
library). This demonstrates the possibility to add post-quantum
cryptography without the need to change the internal logic of the TLS
code within OpenSSL.

Our [BoringSSL fork](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl)
implements post-quantum and hybrid key exchange and post-quantum-only
public key authentication in TLS 1.3, and is interoperable with our
OpenSSL 1.1.1 fork. We also provide a [binary version of the Chromium
web browser](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/releases)
that uses post-quantum algorithms with the help of the BoringSSL fork.

### TLS interop server

To facilitate simple tests between post-quantum-enabled TLS clients and
the OQS implementation, we have made available a public interoperability
test server at <https://test.openquantumsafe.org>.

This is an nginx server running the OQS-enabled OpenSSL stack using TLS
1.3, currently offering 3651 ports with all supported combinations of
post-quantum certificates and key exchange algorithms, both with simple
post-quantum algorithms as well as hybrid PQ+classic cryptography.

We welcome implementers of PQ-enabled TLS implementations to run their
implementations against our implementations and interop server, and
report any interoperabiltity issues on our [Github issue
tracker](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues).

## Other protocols

**SSH.**
We provide a [fork of
OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) that implements
post-quantum and hybrid key exchange and authentication in the SSH
protocol.

**CMS and S/MIME.**
Our [OpenSSL 1.1.1 fork](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl)
includes support for post-quantum and hybrid signing operations in the
CMS and S/MIME secure mail protocols.

## Profiling

We recently launched a new dashboard at
<https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking> visualizing the performance
of the implementations at different levels of the software stack on
different architectures. Currently, measurements on x86_64 (Intel/AMD)
and aarch64 (ARM64) are obtained at the core algorithm level in liboqs
and OpenSSL, and at the level of TLS handshakes (both PQ-only and
hybrid) in OpenSSL. Also shown are the results of executing the pure
reference (C-only) code as well as optimized code versions, and memory
consumption figures (stack and heap).

These tests are meant to complement the much more detailed
[SUPERCOP](https://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html) tests with
virtual-machine-based, application-level performance numbers that are
more indicative of the performance to be seen in actual (cloud)
deployments.

## Getting started quickly with Docker images

To enable researchers and developers to get started quickly with
post-quantum cryptography, we provide ready-to-run Docker images
containing PQ-enabled versions of many of the applications described
above, including:

-   [Apache httpd](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/httpd)
-   [OpenSSH](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/openssh)
-   [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/nginx)
-   [HAProxy](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/haproxy)

### IBM Cloud: QSC-enabled Kubernetes ingress controller & QSC-enabled OpenShift router

To enable clients with quantum-safe cryptography (QSC) protected access
to clusters in the [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud), IBM Research
implemented a custom ingress controller for [IBM Cloud Kubernetes
Service
(IKS)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started)
and a custom router for [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (managed
OpenShift)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-getting-started),
with QSC provided by Open Quantum Safe. Both enable QSC access to the
related clusters in the IBM Cloud. With that, clients can access their
clusters benefitting from QSC protected TLS session key establishment,
while not having to change anything for the services inside their
clusters.

The [custom ingress
controller](https://github.com/IBM/qsc-ingress/blob/main/kubernetes/nginx)
for Kubernetes and [custom router for
ROKS](https://github.com/IBM/qsc-ingress/blob/main/openshift)
respectively are terminating TLSv1.3 connections from a QSC-enabled
application client and feature full backward compatibility for non-QSC
operation. This approach enables network connections to use QSC KEM
algorithms for session key establishment, and also offer the possibility
to use hybrid QSC/non-QSC session key establishment. This hybrid mode of
QSC enablement in TLS offers a way to prepare for the future and take a
staged transition to QSC operation. The implementation is based on the
community NGINX ingress controller and HAProxy ingress controller, with
QSC-enabled OpenSSL 1.1.1g libraries provided by Open Quantum Safe.

More information as well as performance testing with concurrent requests
can be found under <https://github.com/IBM/qsc-ingress>.
