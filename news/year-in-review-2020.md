# Year in review – 2020

*January, 2021*

## Software releases

Our major software goal for the year was updating our core library, liboqs, and our associated sub-projects, to use algorithms from Round 3 of the NIST Post-Quantum Crypto standardization project.

### Docker images

Going beyond providing instructions how to build docker images OQS is now actively maintaining several ready-to-run images for an easy start into the topic: These include post-quantum enabled integrations of:

- [OpenSSL/curl](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/curl)
- [Apache httpd](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/httpd)
- [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/nginx)
- [openssh](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/openssh)
- [haproxy](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/haproxy)
- [OpenSSL provider](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/oqs-ossl3)

## Papers and Presentations

## Impact

## Partners

Financial support for OQS in 2020 came from Amazon Web Services and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security.  Research projects based on OQS were supported by funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).  Microsoft Research donated computation time on Azure. IBM Research and individual contributors provided developer time to move OQS forward.

## Plans for 2021

The efforts on OQS shall be presented at the [PQ NIST conference](https://csrc.nist.gov/Events/2021/third-pqc-standardization-conference) in order to help us better focus our activities.

Thanks to all who have helped OQS advance over the past year!
