## Open Quantum Safe, Cryptographic Research Architect position 

*(posted June 18, 2025)*

The Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo invites applications from qualified candidates for a 2-year position as a Cryptographic Research Architect on the Open Quantum Safe project. 

This position is available immediately in Professor Stebila’s research group. You will be working with a world-wide team of researchers and developers from academia and industry on the Open Quantum Safe project (openquantumsafe.org). You will have the opportunity to push the boundaries of applied post-quantum cryptography and contribute to various open-source projects. You will help integrate new post-quantum cryptographic algorithms into the liboqs open-source library, and design and implement techniques for evaluating and benchmarking these cryptographic algorithms in a variety of contexts. The field of post-quantum cryptography is rapidly evolving, and you will need to track ongoing changes to algorithms due to peer review and advances by researchers via the the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography project forum.  In addition to algorithm research, tasks cover all aspects of the software development lifecycle and include design, programming cryptographic algorithms, integrating other cryptographic implementations into the liboqs framework, integrating liboqs into 3rd party open-source projects, testing, benchmarking and documentation. You may be asked to take an ownership role in coordinating the development of various sub-components of the Open Quantum Safe project.

### Qualifications:

- Undergraduate or Graduate degree in Mathematics, Computer Science or Electrical and Computer Engineering
- Essential: C programming experience, at least 3 years.
- Essential: Familiarity with cryptographic algorithms including public key and symmetric key cryptography, digital signatures, message digest, and hashing algorithms
- Essential: Familiarity with version control systems (Git & Github workflow)
- Familiarity with cryptographic protocols such as TLS and SSH
- Familiarity with code analysis tools like Coverity and valgrind
- Familiarity with one or more of: Python, Java, Go, Rust, C++
- Familiarity with software build systems (CMake)
- Familiarity with continuous integration systems (Github Actrions)

The appointment will be a full-time position for 2 years. The salary range is CAD$80,000–$115,000/year and commensurate with experience.
